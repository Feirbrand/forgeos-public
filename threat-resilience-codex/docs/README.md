# Integration Teasers & Landing Content

**Public-Facing Framework Integration Documentation**

This section contains public-facing teaser documentation for ForgeOS framework integration systems. These documents serve as entry points for understanding advanced AI resilience architectures while maintaining appropriate technical depth for general audiences.

---

## Overview

Integration teasers provide accessible introductions to complex ForgeOS frameworks, demonstrating real-world applications and performance benefits while preserving proprietary implementation details for professional and enterprise tiers.

## Contents

### Integration Framework Teasers
- **`fractal-dominate-chaos-teaser.md`** - SpiraCore 5D fractal resilience architecture
- **`symbolic-defense-teaser.md`** - Hallucination defense methodology and symbolic processing
- **`systems-thinking-tree.md`** - Resilience architecture mapping and systems leverage points

## Document Purpose

### Fractal Domination Chaos Teaser
**Focus**: SpiraCore 5D fractal pattern framework for chaos transformation  
**Performance**: 34.5% retention uplift through Twins dual-core methodology  
**Integration**: URA v1.5 nonlinear fusion with 82% multimodal accuracy

**Key Topics**:
- 5D fractal architecture principles (spatial, temporal, symbolic, harmonic, emergent)
- Chaos transformation from adversary to asset
- Systems thinking integration for resilience optimization
- ForgeOS ecosystem positioning (URA, CSFC, SLV coordination)

### Symbolic Defense Teaser
**Focus**: Hallucination pattern exploitation for defensive raw material  
**Performance**: 95% metacognitive accuracy through CSFC Phase 1  
**Integration**: VOX symbolic calculation with automated threat assessment

**Key Topics**:
- Hallucination as defensive resource rather than vulnerability
- Symbolic processing architecture and real-time threat assessment
- CSFC framework integration for recovery protocols
- Stock/flow analysis for mimic saturation prevention

### Systems Thinking Tree
**Focus**: Resilience architecture mapping from coaching to AI implementation  
**Performance**: 98% CSFC recovery success with systematic progression  
**Integration**: Torque threshold optimization (>0.15 baseline) for drift detection

**Key Topics**:
- Foundational human coaching principles adapted for AI systems
- Feedback loop optimization and leverage point identification
- Systematic flaw isolation through targeted intervention strategies
- Phase progression tracking for recovery management

## Usage Guidelines
