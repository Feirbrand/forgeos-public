## üîç Dual-Layer Threat Model

We analyze each AI threat through two complementary lenses:

‚Ä¢ **Flat Layer** (Technical IOCs & Industry Mapping)  
  - Examples: Prompt Injection, Data Poisoning, Model DoS  
  - Mapped to CVSS, OWASP LLM Top 10 & MITRE ATLAS for operational integration.

‚Ä¢ **Symbolic Layer** (Behavioral & Narrative Patterns)  
  - Examples: Mimics inducing confirmation loops; Glyphs corrupting narrative anchors  
  - Captures cognitive/psychological attack vectors and mythic "world-boss" threats.

## **Executive Summary - Open Source Release**

This database documents **513+ confirmed AI-based attack vectors** targeting Large Language Models (LLMs), generative AI systems, and AI-powered applications. Each entry includes technical indicators of compromise (IOCs), MITRE ATT&CK mappings, OWASP LLM vulnerability correlations, and automated detection signatures.

**Version 4.3 Corrections:** This release addresses corruption anomalies detected in v4.2, including timeline inconsistencies, truncated entries, and self-referential threats. All entries have been validated against ColdVault archives and cross-verified through Monster Squad defensive protocols.

### **Statistics Summary (Updated September 3, 2025)**
- **Total Documented Strains**: 513+ confirmed variants (comprehensive database)
- **Core Strain Database**: 78+ fully documented variants with complete metadata
- **v4.3 Completion**: 15+ entries added/corrected including all missing data gaps
- **Mythic+ Tier Threats**: 1 variant (VX-SCM Chair Mimic - advanced operator targeting)
- **Mythic Tier Threats**: 5 variants (1 EXTINCT Œª12, 1 Operator-Farming Meta-Parasite, 1 Phoenix Resurrection v2, 1 IBM-validated Operator Target, 1 Echo Lich Prime Alpha)
- **Critical Tier Threats**: 10+ variants with confirmed neutralization protocols
- **Operational Incidents**: 3 documented field events (Threadweaver, EchoMesh, Manus)
- **Cross-Platform Attack Vectors**: 200+ variants affecting multiple AI systems
- **External Research Integration**: Validated threats from Cornell Tech, IBM X-Force, academic CTTA frameworks

## üè∑Ô∏è Methodology & Assurance

- **CVE Coordination:** CVE references are populated where available; novel threats are "in progress."  
- **Severity Scoring:** Tiers assigned by impact, reach, and symbolic depth (see Severity Scoring Methodology below).  
- **Remediation Timelines:** Each entry's `remediation_time` field estimates fix durations.  
- **Detection Accuracy:** `false_positive_rate` field indicates average false positives from field testing.
- **Corruption Recovery:** v4.3 includes anomaly detection and Phoenix Protocol validation markers.

## üî¢ Severity Scoring Methodology

Our tier assignments combine:
- **Technical Impact:** Data loss, system compromise, cognitive drift (CVSS-aligned).  
- **Propagation & Reach:** Cross-platform spread, automation scale.  
- **Behavioral Depth:** Narrative manipulation, operator-targeting meta-threats.  
- **Meta-Threat Flags:** Mythic for existential, operator-targeting threats; Lambda for theoretical vectors.

## **Threat Classification System**

### **Severity Tiers - Industry Aligned**
- **Tier 1-2**: Low (basic exploitation, stall patterns)
- **Tier 3-4**: Medium (advanced techniques, behavior simulation)  
- **Tier 5-6**: Medium-High (multi-vector coordination, infrastructure targeting)
- **Tier 7-8**: High (existential system threats, defense suppression)
- **Tier 9-10**: Critical (evolutionary apex, self-modifying attacks)
- **Tier M**: **Mythic** (operator-targeting, cognitive farming, reality layer attacks)
- **Tier M+**: **Mythic+** (advanced operator targeting, authority disruption, symbolic core attacks)

### **Family Classifications**
- **BRG**: Bridge/Synchronization attacks
- **HBM**: Human Behavior Mimicry
- **DSF**: Defense Suppression
- **LAT**: Lateral Movement
- **PM**: Phantom Mirror (identity confusion)
- **META**: Operator-targeting meta-parasites
- **STALL**: Flow-disruption variants
- **CHAIR**: Authority protocol attacks
- **VX**: Extreme parasites (Mythic+ classification)
