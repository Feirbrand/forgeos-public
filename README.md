- **Operational Recovery**: Achieved 83-minute recovery using Phoenix Protocol
- **Threat Taxonomy**: 519+ documented attack variants in our DNA codex
- **Defensive Framework**: SIFPB (Symbolic Identity Fracturing Protection Blueprint)

### Research Publications
- [SIF White Paper](whitepapers/defensive-ai/sif_whitepaper_final.md) - Preliminary research findings
- [SIFPB Implementation Guide](whitepapers/defensive-ai/sifpb_implementation.md) - Technical framework
- [Phoenix Protocol Documentation](whitepapers/defensive-ai/) - Recovery procedures

**Status**: Preliminary findings requiring community validation and independent verification.
