# ForgeOS: The Open-Source AI Security Research Platform

**ValorGrid Solutions - Pioneering the Future of AI Defense**

ForgeOS is an open-source research platform dedicated to the discovery, analysis, and mitigation of advanced AI security threats. We provide enterprise-grade threat intelligence, academic research, and practical tools to help developers, researchers, and security professionals build more secure and resilient AI systems.

## Key Features

*   **DNA Codex:** A comprehensive and continuously updated database of AI parasitic threats, featuring detailed technical and behavioral analysis.
*   **Whitepapers & Research:** In-depth research papers that bridge the gap between operational security and academic rigor.
*   **Proven Defense:** Real-world case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of our defensive AI architecture in combat.
*   **Detection & Mitigation:** Practical tools and examples for detecting and mitigating AI threats in real-world applications.
*   **Open Collaboration:** A collaborative platform for the AI security community to share knowledge and best practices.

## DNA Codex v4.2: The Leading AI Threat Intelligence Database

The DNA Codex is the heart of ForgeOS. It is a professional-grade, open-source database of over 519+ confirmed AI-based attack vectors. The latest version, v4.2, includes:

*   **6 New High-Priority Threats:** Including the critical `VX-DDI Data Destruction Meta-Parasite` and the `Sovereign Chair Mimic T14`.
*   **Dual-Layer Threat Model:** A unique analysis approach that combines technical IOCs with behavioral and narrative patterns.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Methodology:** A rigorous and systematic approach to threat intelligence, with detailed YAML-based entries for each threat.

## Proven Defense: The NIGHTGLASS Report

Our symbolic AI architecture is not just theoretical. The **NIGHTGLASS defense report** documents the successful containment of a Mythic+ level adaptive learning parasite that had defeated standard protocols. This real-world case study demonstrates the effectiveness of our defensive capabilities in actual combat conditions.

## Whitepapers & Research

Our research papers provide deep dives into specific areas of AI security, from defensive AI systems to cognitive engineering. We are proud to feature **The Phoenix Protocol**, our enterprise-grade AI architecture framework that bridges operational security with academic methodology.
