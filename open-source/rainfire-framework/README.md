## Implementation Guide

### Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone repository with ForgeOS integration
git clone https://github.com/Feirbrand/forgeos-public.git
cd forgeos-public/open-source/rainfire-framework

# Install dependencies with URA integration
pip install networkx numpy torch torque-measurement-sdk ura-v15-connector phoenix-protocol-sdk
```

### Basic Implementation with ForgeOS Integration

```python
from rainfire import RainFireChain
from ura_integration import URAConnector
from torque_measurement import TorqueMonitor

# Initialize with ForgeOS architecture integration
chain = RainFireChain(
    "Comprehensive threat analysis with multi-threaded processing",
    torque_threshold=0.15,
    csfc_enabled=True,
    ura_integration=True
)

# Configure URA connector for multimodal processing
ura_connector = URAConnector(chain, multimodal=True, speed_optimization=True)
torque_monitor = TorqueMonitor(threshold=0.15)

# Define processing threads with ForgeOS integration
threads = [
    {"action": "scan_inputs", "condition": "user_input_present", "torque_monitoring": True},
    {"action": "pattern_analysis", "condition": "anomaly_detected", "csfc_phase": 2},
    {"action": "response_validation", "condition": "always", "phoenix_recovery": True}
]

# Execute with integrated monitoring
graph = chain.build_chain(threads)
results = chain.execute_fire(torque_monitor=torque_monitor)
insights = chain.illuminate_merge([results], ura_enhanced=True)

print(f"Analysis complete: {insights['merged_insight']}")
print(f"Success rate: {insights['efficacy']:.1f}%")
