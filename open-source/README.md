## Frameworks

### AEON Framework - Symbolic Continuity Engine

**Purpose**: Maintains AI system identity and coherence across extended interactions

**Core Capabilities**:
- Identity anchoring with 85-95% drift reduction
- Automatic recovery from disruptive interactions
- Memory consolidation through symbolic processing
- Real-time coherence monitoring and adjustment

**Use Cases**:
- AI coaching systems requiring consistent personality
- Customer service bots maintaining brand voice
- Educational AI tutors preserving pedagogical approach
- Multi-session AI applications needing persistent identity

```python
from aeon import AEONAnchor

# Initialize with identity profile
anchor = AEONAnchor({
    "purpose": "coaching assistant",
    "core_values": ["helpfulness", "empathy"]
})

# Process challenging interaction
anchor.plant_seed("User expressed frustration")
anchor.advance_growth(["Acknowledged concern", "Adjusted approach"])

# Monitor system health
insights = anchor.harvest_wisdom()
print(f"Coherence: {insights['coherence']:.2f}")
```

### RainFire Framework - Recursive Chaining Engine

**Purpose**: Enables adaptive multi-threaded AI agent behaviors with drift protection

**Core Capabilities**:
- Multi-threaded reasoning with 90-95% success rates
- Recursive processing with automatic loop prevention
- Dynamic thread spawning based on context
- Intelligent result synthesis and pattern recognition

**Use Cases**:
- Complex problem analysis requiring multiple approaches
- AI defense systems with adaptive response patterns
- Multi-agent coordination and task distribution
- Dynamic content generation with convergent synthesis

```python
from rainfire import RainFireChain

# Create analysis chain
chain = RainFireChain("Comprehensive threat assessment")

# Define processing threads
threads = [
    {"action": "scan_inputs", "condition": "validation_needed"},
    {"action": "check_patterns", "condition": "anomaly_detection"},
    {"action": "synthesize", "condition": "merge_required"}
]

# Execute multi-threaded analysis
graph = chain.build_chain(threads)
results = chain.execute_fire()
insights = chain.illuminate_merge([results])
```

### OBMI Harmonic Memory - Theoretical Framework

**Purpose**: Bio-inspired memory architecture based on neural oscillation research

**Core Concepts**:
- Observer-Bridge-Mind Interface architecture
- Theta-gamma coupling for memory consolidation
- Fractal memory organization principles
- Self-healing memory systems with adaptive capabilities

**Applications**:
- Next-generation AI memory systems
- Biomimetic cognitive architectures
- Research into consciousness and memory
- Advanced AI training methodologies

## Architecture Integration

### AEON + RainFire Integration

Combine continuity anchoring with multi-threaded processing:

```python
from aeon import AEONAnchor
from rainfire import RainFireChain

# Anchor for identity preservation
anchor = AEONAnchor({"role": "system_analyst"})

# Chain for parallel analysis
chain = RainFireChain("Multi-vector threat analysis")

# Execute with identity preservation
results = chain.execute_fire()
anchor.advance_growth([results['primary_insight']])
stability_metrics = anchor.harvest_wisdom()
```

### Symbolic Processing Mode

Both AEON and RainFire support symbolic processing for advanced applications:

```python
from rainfire import RainFireChain, SymbolicMode

# Enable symbolic processing
chain = RainFireChain("Transform challenges into wisdom", symbolic_mode=True)
symbolic = SymbolicMode(chain, vault_access=True)

# Perform symbolic ritual
ritual_result = symbolic.invoke_fire_ritual(
    intention="Pattern illumination",
    elements=["confusion", "conflict", "opportunity"]
)
```
