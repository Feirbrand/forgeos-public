# Open Source Implementations

Functional code implementations of theoretical frameworks from ForgeOS research.

## OBMI Harmonic Memory

Biomimetic memory architecture inspired by neural oscillations and fractal patterns. This implementation demonstrates conceptual frameworks for AI memory systems that maintain context coherence across sessions.

### Components

- **[Core Framework](obmi-harmonic-memory/)** - Base implementation of harmonic memory principles
- **[Jupyter Notebook](obmi-harmonic-memory/obmi_exploration.ipynb)** - Interactive exploration and experimentation
- **[Examples](obmi-harmonic-memory/examples/)** - Practical demonstrations of memory bridging
- **[Documentation](obmi-harmonic-memory/README.md)** - Technical specifications and usage guides

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Feirbrand/forgeos-public.git
cd open-source/obmi-harmonic-memory
jupyter notebook obmi_exploration.ipynb
```

### Attribution

Conceptual development benefited from collaborative discussions with ByteRover community contributions. See CHANGELOG.md for detailed acknowledgments.

## Experimental Status

These implementations represent theoretical explorations of AI memory architecture. They are provided for research and educational purposes. Production applications should undergo thorough testing and validation.
