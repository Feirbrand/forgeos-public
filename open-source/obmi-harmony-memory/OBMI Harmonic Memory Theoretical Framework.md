A conceptual implementation of bio-inspired harmonic memory theory for AI research, demonstrating Observer-Bridge-Mind Interface principles through theta-gamma coupling and fractal recall patterns.

## 🧠 Theory Overview

OBMI (Observer-Bridge-Mind Interface) Harmonic Memory represents a biomimetic approach to artificial intelligence memory architecture that transcends traditional storage-retrieval paradigms. This theoretical framework draws from cutting-edge neuroscience research on neural oscillations and memory consolidation.

### Key Concepts

- **Observer Layer**: External input processing and contextual awareness
- **Bridge Layer**: Translation and harmonic coordination between memory systems  
- **Mind Layer**: Core memory processing with fractal self-similar recall
- **Theta-Gamma Coupling**: Bio-inspired rhythmic patterns for memory threading
- **Fractal Compression**: Self-similar pattern recognition across multiple scales

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Feirbrand/obmi-harmonic-memory-theory.git
cd obmi-harmonic-memory-theory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.harmonic_memory import OBMIMemorySimulator

# Initialize simulator
simulator = OBMIMemorySimulator(theta_freq=7, gamma_freq=40, coupling_strength=0.5)

# Process input through OBMI layers
input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Example symbolic context
observed = simulator.observe(input_data)
signal, phase, amplitude = simulator.bridge(observed)
recalled = simulator.mind_recall(signal)

print(f"Harmonic memory threading complete: {len(recalled)} elements processed")
```

### Interactive Demo

Run the Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration:

```bash
jupyter notebook examples/obmi_harmonic_demo.ipynb
```

## 📊 Theoretical Performance Projections

- **>50% improvement** in memory persistence and recall accuracy
- **>20% reduction** in operational latency through harmonic optimization
- **Self-healing capabilities** with automated corruption recovery
- **Enhanced resilience** against adversarial memory attacks
