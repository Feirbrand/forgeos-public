- Maintain compatibility with Python 3.8+

### Documentation Standards
```python
def harmonic_function(theta_freq: float, gamma_freq: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generate harmonic signal based on theta-gamma coupling.
    
    This function demonstrates the theoretical principle of theta-gamma
    phase coupling as observed in biological memory systems.
    
    Args:
        theta_freq: Theta frequency in Hz (typically 4-8 Hz)
        gamma_freq: Gamma frequency in Hz (typically 30-80 Hz)
    
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Harmonic signal demonstrating coupled oscillations

```

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for complex workflows  
- Performance benchmarks for algorithms
- Documentation tests for examples

## Review Process

### Theoretical Contributions

- Distinguish between empirical claims and theoretical speculation

### Open Science Principles
- Make research reproducible through clear documentation
- Provide data and code for theoretical demonstrations
- Encourage peer review and community validation
- Maintain transparency about theoretical vs. empirical claims

## Community Guidelines

### Respectful Collaboration
- Focus on ideas rather than personalities
- Provide constructive feedback on contributions
- Acknowledge different perspectives on theoretical questions
- Maintain professional discourse in all interactions

### Quality Standards
- Theoretical contributions must be well-researched
- Code must be clean, tested, and documented
- Claims must be substantiated or clearly marked as speculative
- Integration examples should be realistic and practical
