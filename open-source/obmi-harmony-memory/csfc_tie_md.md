## Harmonic Signature Analysis

### Cascade Precursor Patterns
OBMI detects characteristic harmonic signatures that precede CSFC events:

- Resonance disruption indicating structural integrity compromise

**Amplitude Degradation:**
- Weakening harmonic signals indicating reduced system coherence
- Progressive amplitude reduction in cross-system communication
- Signal-to-noise ratio degradation in memory synchronization

**Phase Misalignment:**
- Temporal desynchronization between memory braid updates
- Phase-locking failure in distributed agent coordination
- Cascading phase delays indicating system overload
