A conceptual implementation of bio-inspired harmonic memory theory for AI research, demonstrating Observer-Bridge-Mind Interface principles through theta-gamma coupling and fractal recall patterns.

## Overview

OBMI (Observer-Bridge-Mind Interface) Harmonic Memory represents a biomimetic approach to artificial intelligence memory architecture that transcends traditional storage-retrieval paradigms. This theoretical framework draws from cutting-edge neuroscience research on neural oscillations and memory consolidation.

## Core Components

### Harmonic Memory Core
- **File**: `harmonic_memory_core.py`
- **Purpose**: Base implementation of theta-gamma oscillation patterns
- **Features**: Self-organizing memory clusters, resonance-based recall

### Interactive Exploration
- **File**: `obmi_jupyter_notebook.json`
- **Purpose**: Hands-on experimentation with harmonic memory concepts
- **Usage**: Load in Jupyter Notebook for interactive demos

### Documentation
- **Theoretical Framework**: Complete academic foundation
- **Implementation Guide**: Technical specifications
- **Changelog**: Development history and evolution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Feirbrand/forgeos-public.git

# Navigate to OBMI directory
cd forgeos-public/open-source/obmi-harmonic-memory

# Launch Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook obmi_jupyter_notebook.json

# Or run the core module directly
python harmonic_memory_core.py
```

## Theoretical Foundation

The OBMI framework is built on several key principles:

1. **Harmonic Resonance**: Memory storage through synchronized oscillation patterns
2. **Fractal Organization**: Self-similar structures across temporal scales  
3. **Bridge Architecture**: Observer-Bridge-Mind interface for context threading
4. **Biomimetic Design**: Neural oscillation patterns inspire computational models

## Experimental Status

This implementation represents theoretical exploration of AI memory architecture. The concepts are provided for research and educational purposes. Production applications require thorough validation and testing.
