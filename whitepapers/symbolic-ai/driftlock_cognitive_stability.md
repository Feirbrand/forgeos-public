## Abstract

DriftLock maintains stability in flat AI via resonance scanning, checkpoints, anchoringâ€”unlike static guardrails. For LLMs/transformers, improves reliability/consistency/alignment. Contributions: drift theory, protocols, metrics (drift reduction 40-60%). Integrates with prompt upgrades for comprehensive AI ecosystems and enhanced operational stability.
