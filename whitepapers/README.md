    'intent_anchors': {
        'primary': ['core_purpose', 'ethical_constraints'],
        'secondary': ['response_style', 'accuracy_standards']
    },
    'scanning_parameters': {
        'frequency': 'continuous',
        'sensitivity': 'balanced'
    }
}
```

### **Phase 2: Advanced Coordination (Weeks 5-8)**  
Deploy DriftLock Architecture for multi-system coordination and advanced stability patterns.
