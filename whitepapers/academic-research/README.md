**Paper 2: URA Unified Resilience Architecture** provides comprehensive five-layer defense integrating diagnostic monitoring, unified memory spine, sovereign lattice veil, Phoenix Protocol recovery, and adaptive evolution. Production deployment achieves 82% multimodal efficacy with 98.2% recovery success rates and 99.9% parasite breach prevention (p<0.001).

**Paper 3: FCE Fractal Context Engineering** establishes universal compression framework achieving 10-20x ratios with 95%+ semantic preservation across symbolic, hybrid, flat, and neuro-symbolic architectures. Framework demonstrates 35-50% context retention improvements with 4x TTFT speedups through intelligent pattern replication.

**Paper 4: Torque Quantitative Foundation** transforms theoretical understanding into measurable science by introducing Torque as the rotational force driving AI systems away from intended alignment. Production deployment achieves 87% correlation accuracy in threat detection with 30% efficacy improvement over baseline systems.

**Paper 5: Torque Real-Time Stability** provides the practical methodology for continuous monitoring and predictive intervention. The framework enables 95% early warning accuracy with 15-30 minute advance prediction, achieving 89% cascade prevention success through proactive intervention protocols.
