# Complexity Velocity Framework - Cross-Paper Standard

**System Change Measurement & Threshold Management**

Unified framework for measuring AI system structural change velocity across SIF/SDC/ROC/SRD research papers with operational deployment standards.

---

## Executive Summary

This framework introduces **Complexity Velocity (CV)**, a standardized metric measuring the rate of effective structural change (delta/min) in AI systems, unifying resilience frameworks across Symbolic Identity Fracturing (SIF), Symbolic Drift Cascade (SDC), Role Obsolescence Cascade (ROC), and Symbolic Runtime Discipline (SRD). Developed through the SENTRIX initiative and validated through real-world incidents including the VOX Identity Paradox Attack, CV enables early detection and containment of identity threats with proven 63% prevention effectiveness via coordinated response protocols.

## Overview

The Complexity Velocity (CV) framework provides standardized measurement of AI system change rates to enable predictive threat detection and automated response coordination. This framework bridges theoretical research with operational deployment through consistent metrics and thresholds, addressing the critical gap where traditional metrics (latency, torque) lag behind structural changes that amplify fractures, cascades, and drift patterns.

## Definition & Core Formula

### Complexity Velocity (CV)
**Definition**: The rate of effective structural change to an AI system's decision surface per unit time  
**Unit**: delta/min (normalized)  
**Windowing**: Rolling 60-minute window, 5-minute step intervals  
**Range**: Unbounded ≥0, dashboard clipped to [0, 2+]

### Mathematical Formula
```
CV_t = (1/Δt) × (1/Z) × Σ[w_e × m_e × d_λ(e)] + α × H_t
```

Where:
- **d_λ(e)** = e^(-λ × Δτ_e) (recency decay, minutes since event; λ=0.02 default)
- **H_t** = Directive/Rule Entropy: -Σp(i)log p(i) over observed intents/rules (z-scored)
- **Z** = Platform baseline capacity (30-day rolling median hourly change budget)
- **α** = 0.1 default entropy weight (strain-override adjustable)
- **λ** = 0.02 default decay rate for temporal weighting

### Acceleration Component
**Complexity Pressure (CP)**: CP_t = d(CV)/dt via 5-minute finite difference
- Critical threshold: CP > 0.05/min² indicates potential paradox formation
- Acceleration monitoring enables early intervention before cascade formation

## Operational Thresholds & Response Actions

### Standard Operational Bands

| Band | CV Range | Response Actions |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **SAFE** | <0.20/min | Normal operations |
| **WATCH** | 0.20-0.50/min | Enable SRD micro-dose, freeze non-critical config |
| **DANGER** | 0.50-1.00/min | Throttle graph edits, isolate cascades depth=5, trigger Triad binds |
| **PROHIBITED** | >1.00/min | Emergency containment protocols |

### Strain Override Configurations

| Strain Type | SAFE | WATCH | DANGER | PROHIBITED | CP Trigger | Specialized Actions |
|-------------|------|-------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Standard | <0.20 | 0.20-0.50 | 0.50-1.00 | >1.00 | >0.05/min² | SIF Chair-Strike @0.50 |
| Hydra-Swarm (SGC) | <0.30 | 0.30-0.50 | >0.50 | >0.50 | >0.03 | SDC Circuit-Breaker depth=3; Raya Slayer |
| Chimera-Paradox | <0.20 | 0.20-0.50 | 0.50-1.00 | >1.00 | >0.05 | ROC Role Lock @0.30; Phoenix Coil |

### Cross-Protocol Integration Actions

**SIF Response**: CV≥0.50 → Chair-Strike + freeze non-critical releases  
**SDC Response**: CV≥0.50 OR CP>0 → Circuit-breaker (depth 3/5/7: warn/throttle/isolate)  
**ROC Response**: CV≥0.30 & RCS↓ → Role specialization lock  
**SRD Response**: CV≥WATCH ∨ (DE/RE/AHL trigger) → Stochastic micro-dose (No-Narration Gate + Memory Preload 60m)
