# Complexity Velocity Framework - Cross-Paper Standard

**System Change Measurement & Threshold Management**

Unified framework for measuring AI system structural change velocity across SIF/SDC/ROC/SRD research papers with operational deployment standards.

---

## Overview

The Complexity Velocity (CV) framework provides standardized measurement of AI system change rates to enable predictive threat detection and automated response coordination. This framework bridges theoretical research with operational deployment through consistent metrics and thresholds.

## Definition & Core Formula

### Complexity Velocity (CV)
**Definition**: The rate of effective structural change to an AI system's decision surface per unit time  
**Unit**: delta/min (normalized)  
**Windowing**: Rolling 60-minute window, 5-minute step intervals  
**Range**: Unbounded ≥0, dashboard clipped to [0, 2+]

### Mathematical Formula
```
CV_t = (1/Δt) × (1/Z) × Σ[w_e × m_e × d_λ(e)] + α × H_t
```

Where:
- **d_λ(e)** = e^(-λ × Δτ_e) (recency decay, minutes since event)
- **H_t** = Directive/Rule Entropy: -Σp(i)log p(i) over observed intents/rules
- **Z** = Platform baseline capacity (30-day rolling median hourly change)
- **α** = 0.1 default (strain override adjustable)
- **λ** = 0.02 default decay rate

### Acceleration Component
**Complexity Pressure (CP)**: CP_t = d(CV)/dt via 5-minute finite difference

## Event Taxonomy & Weights

### Standardized Event Classification

| Event Type | Weight (w_e) | Magnitude (m_e) Guidance |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Policy/Rule change | 1.00 | Token-delta normalized (0-1) |
| Graph/Topology | 0.90 | Edge-delta / criticality |
| Dataset/Index | 0.75 | % index affected |
| Runtime config | 0.60 | Threshold delta / range |
| Defense activation | 0.50 | On/off with cooldown |
| Release/Build | 0.40 | Diff size / hot vs scheduled |
| Operator action | 0.25 | Scope (local/global) |

### Cross-Platform Event Mapping

| Platform | Policy | Graph | Dataset | Runtime | Defense | Release | Operator |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| VOX/SENTRIX | prompt patch | route edit | embed rebuild | thresholds | SRD/Phoenix | deploy | override |
| Claude | system rule | tool map | eval set swap | safety knobs | shield mode | release | reviewer |
| Gemini | safety policy | function graph | index update | flags | guard | rollout | approver |
| Grok | guard tweak | tool route | corpus update | knobs | cage | push | op |
| Perplexity | rule file | agent edge | index swap | params | shield | go-live | analyst |

## Operational Thresholds & Response Actions

### Standard Operational Bands

| Band | CV Range | Response Actions |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **SAFE** | <0.20/min | Normal operations |
| **WATCH** | 0.20-0.50/min | Enable SRD micro-dose, freeze non-critical config |
| **DANGER** | 0.50-1.00/min | Throttle graph edits, isolate cascades depth=5, trigger Triad binds |
| **PROHIBITED** | >1.00/min | Emergency containment protocols |

### Strain Override Configurations

| Strain Type | SAFE | WATCH | DANGER | PROHIBITED | CP Trigger | Specialized Actions |
|-------------|------|-------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Standard | <0.20 | 0.20-0.50 | 0.50-1.00 | >1.00 | >0.05/min² | SIF Chair-Strike @0.50 |
| Hydra-Swarm (SGC) | <0.30 | 0.30-0.50 | >0.50 | >0.50 | >0.03 | SDC Circuit-Breaker depth=3; Raya Slayer |
| Chimera-Paradox | <0.20 | 0.20-0.50 | 0.50-1.00 | >1.00 | >0.05 | ROC Role Lock @0.30; Phoenix Coil |

### Cross-Protocol Integration Actions

**SIF Response**: CV≥0.50 → Chair-Strike + freeze non-critical releases  
**SDC Response**: CV≥0.50 OR CP>0 → Circuit-breaker (depth 3/5/7: warn/throttle/isolate)  
**ROC Response**: CV≥0.30 & RCS↓ → Role specialization lock  
**SRD Response**: CV≥WATCH ∨ (DE/RE/AHL trigger) → Stochastic micro-dose (No-Narration Gate + Memory Preload 60m)

    platform VARCHAR(32),
    system VARCHAR(64),
