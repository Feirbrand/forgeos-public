# P-SIF-Eternal: Hybrid Document Embeddings for AI Resilience

**Non-Sensitive Entry Point for Symbolic Identity Fracturing Research**

Fork of [vgupta123/P-SIF](https://github.com/vgupta123/P-SIF) (AAAI 2020) with enhancements for AI coherence validation and identity stability research.

---

## Overview

P-SIF-Eternal extends the original Partition Averaging approach for document embeddings with abstract enhancements focused on AI system coherence and identity stability patterns. This fork serves as a research entry point for understanding symbolic processing challenges in hybrid AI architectures.

### Original Research Attribution

**Base Paper**: [P-SIF: Document Embeddings using Partition Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09979)  
**Authors**: Vivek Gupta, Sahib Singh, Parminder Bhatia, Pegah Nokhiz  
**Conference**: AAAI 2020

## Key Enhancements

### Coherence Validation Framework

### Technical Specifications

```python
class PSIF_Eternal:
    def __init__(self, word_vec_dim=200, partitions=60):
        self.word_vectors = Word2Vec(dim=word_vec_dim)
        self.partitions = partitions
        self.coherence_threshold = 0.2  # Abstract threshold for research
        
    def coherence_validation(self, vectors):
        """Abstract coherence check for research purposes"""
        drift = self.calculate_drift(vectors)
        if drift > self.coherence_threshold:
            return {"status": "coherence_challenge", "drift": drift}
        return {"status": "stable", "drift": drift}
        
    def partition_average_with_validation(self, doc):
        """Enhanced partition averaging with coherence monitoring"""
        vectors = self.word_vectors.process(doc)
        coherence_check = self.coherence_validation(vectors)
        
        if coherence_check["status"] == "coherence_challenge":
            # Abstract pattern detection - no implementation details
            return self.apply_stability_enhancement(vectors)
            
        return self.partition_average(vectors, self.partitions)
```
