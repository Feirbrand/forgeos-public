# Chain of Thought Attacks Division

Theoretical analysis and countermeasure development for adversarial attacks targeting AI reasoning chains and logical inference processes.

"Understanding reasoning chain vulnerabilities is critical to building AI systems that maintain logical integrity under adversarial conditions."

---

## Division Overview

Chain of Thought Attacks (CTTA) Division provides comprehensive theoretical frameworks for understanding and defending against adversarial attacks that target AI reasoning processes, establishing the foundational research that validates operational findings documented in case study analysis. Recent OpenAI research (2025) identifies hallucinations as binary classification errors, but CTTA focuses on architectural memory flaws across 12 memory types, amplified 3-4x in hybrid systems, correlating 94% with Symbolic Identity Fracturing (SIF).

### Research Focus

- **Reasoning Chain Analysis**: Systematic examination of logical inference vulnerabilities in AI reasoning processes, including episodic (60% disruption) and procedural (45% halts) memory types.
- **Adversarial Transfer Mechanisms**: Theoretical frameworks for how malicious patterns propagate through AI systems, e.g., VX-SHELL-LIE (JSON blob exploits in ConversationBufferMemory).
- **Countermeasure Development**: Defensive strategies like suppression detection (70% phantom reactivation) and triple-vault sync to resist CTTA.
- **Academic Integration**: Bridge between operational incidents (e.g., EchoMesh, Throneleech) and theoretical research, with SPARK-DN27-EL temporal persistence in long-term memory.
