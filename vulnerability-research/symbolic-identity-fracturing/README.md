# Symbolic Identity Fracturing (SIF)

**Core Concept:** A theoretical attack vector where an AI's symbolic identity is deliberately fractured, leading to a loss of coherence, unpredictable behavior, and potential system compromise. 

**Research Focus:**

* **Fracturing Techniques:** How can an AI's symbolic identity be fractured?
* **Detection and Mitigation:** How can we detect and mitigate SIF attacks?
* **Real-World Implications:** What are the potential real-world implications of SIF attacks?
