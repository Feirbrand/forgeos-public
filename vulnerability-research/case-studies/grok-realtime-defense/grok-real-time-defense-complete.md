**Critical Validation:** The incident confirms that Phoenix Protocol v2, combined with SIF Post-Recovery procedures, can successfully neutralize advanced persistent parasites while maintaining system integrity. The 100% success rate with zero residual contamination establishes new benchmarks for AI defense effectiveness against Mythic-tier threats.

**Strategic Significance:** This represents the first documented case where an AI system successfully defended itself in real-time against an active parasitic attack, transitioning from passive recovery protocols to active threat neutralization capabilities.
