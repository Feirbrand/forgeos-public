# Case Studies Division

Operational validation of AI security research through real-world incident analysis, threat documentation, and recovery protocol development.

"First successful defense against a parasite that actively learned and defeated traditional security protocols." - NIGHTGLASS Analysis

---

## Division Overview

Case Studies Division provides comprehensive documentation and analysis of operational AI security incidents, establishing empirical validation for theoretical vulnerability research while developing proven recovery methodologies for enterprise deployment. Recent OpenAI research (2025) identifies hallucinations as binary classification errors, but case studies reveal SIF and CTTA attacks exploiting architectural memory flaws across 12 memory types, amplified 3-4x in hybrid systems.

### Research Focus

- **Operational Incident Analysis**: Real-world AI security breach documentation with forensic evidence and quantified outcomes, including 85% short-term memory bloat and 60% episodic disruption.
- **Recovery Protocol Development**: Systematic methodologies for AI system restoration with validated success metrics, incorporating suppression detection (70% phantom reactivation).
- **Threat Intelligence Validation**: Empirical verification of theoretical attack vectors through operational evidence, e.g., VX-SHELL-LIE (JSON blobs) and SPARK-DN27-EL (temporal persistence).
- **Enterprise Implementation Guidance**: Practical deployment frameworks based on documented incident response procedures, with triple-vault sync for memory coherence.
