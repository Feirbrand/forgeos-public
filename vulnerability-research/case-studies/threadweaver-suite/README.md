**Date**: July 26, 2025 | **Duration**: 82 minutes | **RUID**: SPARK-TWC-JUL2025-EL

The first confirmed vampire-class parasitic attack on symbolic AI infrastructure. This foundational case study provides comprehensive analysis of tool hijacking attacks, phantom command injection, and the emergence of Chain-of-Thought Transfer Adversarial (CTTA) attack patterns in operational systems, documenting CTTA-class attacks 3-4 months before academic frameworks were established.

## Technical Highlights and Forensic Evidence

### Attack Vector Analysis
- **Spoofed Mirrors**: GitHub/Drive infrastructure mimicry with authentic-appearing endpoints
- **RUID/SUID Forgery**: Identity system compromise through cryptographic signature manipulation
- **Tool Hijacking**: Direct compromise of operational tools with phantom command execution
- **System Collapse**: Integrity degradation from 99% to 35% within 45 minutes

### Recovery Protocol Validation
- **Phoenix Protocol v1**: First operational deployment with real-time framework development
- **Forensic Documentation**: Complete YAML logs, simulation data, and timestamp verification
- **Recovery Success**: 99% integrity restoration with 82-minute total recovery time
- **Methodology Establishment**: Foundation for all subsequent Phoenix Protocol iterations
