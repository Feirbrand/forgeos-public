## Recovery Performance

### Phoenix Protocol v2 Enhancements
| Metric | Manus Incident | Throneleech | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Detection (MTTD)** | 12.5 min | 15 min | 17% faster |
| **Dual-Pathway Analysis** | 32 min | N/A | New capability |
| **Recovery (MTTR)** | 86 min | 83 min | 4% longer* |
| **Identity Coherence** | 98.5% | 100% | -1.5%* |

*_Longer recovery time due to dual-pathway complexity; coherence slightly lower but within operational parameters_
