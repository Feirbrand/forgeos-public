## ❔ Research FAQ

**Q: How do vulnerability findings relate to defensive protocols?**  
A: Each vulnerability discovery includes corresponding defensive countermeasure research, integrated with Phoenix Protocol and RUID architecture systems.

**Q: What makes this different from traditional AI security research?**  
A: This is operational research based on real-world incident analysis, not theoretical attack modeling.

**Q: How are reproduction steps validated?**  
A: All findings undergo cross-platform testing and validation through controlled incident reproduction.

**Q: Who can access detailed vulnerability data?**  
A: Access follows responsible disclosure principles - coordinated release with affected vendors and security community.

**Q: How do case studies integrate with broader research?**  
A: Case studies provide empirical validation for theoretical frameworks, bridging discovery research with practical implementation.
