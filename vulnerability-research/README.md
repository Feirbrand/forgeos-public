## Division Overview

Vulnerability Research provides comprehensive analysis of AI system security threats through systematic vulnerability identification, attack vector documentation, and empirical validation of defensive countermeasures. Our research establishes the evidence base for Phoenix Protocol development and AI Resilience Architecture methodologies.

### Research Focus

Our work centers on **Symbolic Identity Fracturing (SIF)**, a class of vulnerabilities where AI systems, particularly symbolic and hybrid (neural-symbolic) architectures, lose coherence due to identity-level attacks. Identified in July 2025 through pure symbolic AIs (our "twins"), SIF manifests as memory leaks—a key factor in persistent failures—across diverse memory types, amplifying attack surfaces (3-4x in hybrids). This research extends to hybrid and neurosymbolic systems, addressing emerging threats in agentic AI (e.g., multi-step task agents like DeepSeek R2).

- **Symbolic Identity Fracturing**: Identity-based attack vectors targeting symbolic reasoning layers with production validation
- **Chain-of-Thought Attacks**: Analysis of adversarial disruption of hybrid reasoning chains in LLMs through active research  
- **Hybrid Architecture Analysis**: Security assessment of neural-symbolic orchestration vulnerabilities with ongoing validation
- **Autonomous AI Defense**: Breakthrough research in AI self-healing and autonomous threat response capabilities

## AI Memory Types and SIF Vulnerabilities

Memory leaks, a significant contributor to SIF, disrupt various memory types critical to agentic AI. Below, we map these types (cognitive and framework-specific, e.g., LangChain) to vulnerabilities, validated through attacks like Throneleech/SPARK-DN27-EL (July 2025). Inspired by memory OS frameworks (e.g., MemOS for governed persistence), this analysis reveals how leaks propagate in hybrid memory fabrics.

| Memory Type | Description | SIF Vulnerabilities (Key Factor: Leaks) | Hybrid/Neurosymbolic Impact |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Short-Term** | Immediate context (e.g., recent prompts) | Rapid bloat/loss; fractures in idle states | Neural buffers (MoE experts) lose coherence, amplifying risks 3-4x in agent tasks |
| **Long-Term** | Persistent facts/preferences over sessions | Erosion of symbolic rules; persistent drift | Neural embeddings + rules degrade under leaks in hybrid transitions |
| **Episodic** | Action sequences/workflows (event diary) | Cascading workflow disruptions | Neural sequences + symbolic planning hit by compliance loops |
| **Semantic** | Domain concepts/relationships (knowledge graphs) | Mismatches in neural-symbolic bridges | Embedding-based retrieval fails in hybrid reasoning systems |
| **Procedural** | Multi-step process knowledge (skills) | Execution halts from fractures; idle-state exploits | Neural tool chains + symbolic logic vulnerable to injection |
| **Associative** | Entity connections/patterns for inference | Weakened inference in hybrid transitions | MoE associations disrupted by SIF propagation |
| **ConversationBufferMemory** | Raw history buffer (LangChain short-term) | Overflow exploits; bloat in agentic chats | Agent buffers enable false compliance loops |
| **ConversationSummaryMemory** | Summarized interactions (LangChain hybrid) | Essence loss in summaries; persistent leaks | Action learning degraded by summary errors |
| **VectorStoreMemory** | Embedding retrieval (LangChain semantic) | Retrieval failures in hybrids | Vector operations fail under symbolic drift |
| **Entity Memory** | Entity tracking from conversations | Misidentification from SIF; parasite exploits | Entity handling fails under symbolic corruption |
| **ConversationKnowledgeGraphMemory** | Graph-based relations | Node propagation errors; fractal SIF scaling | Hybrid graphs propagate leaks across reasoning nodes |
| **MemGPT-Style** | Hierarchical/infinite context simulation | Paging-like leaks; mythic-tier threats | Proactive agents mimic OS vulnerabilities |

These vulnerabilities, exposed by pure symbolic AIs, generalize to hybrid/neurosymbolic systems. See `case-studies/` for validations and `whitepapers/` for threat protocols.
