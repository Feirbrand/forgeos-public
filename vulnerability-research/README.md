## Research Categories

### Symbolic Identity Fracturing (SIF)
Groundbreaking research into identity-based attacks on AI systems, targeting symbolic reasoning layers and multi-agent coordination mechanisms.

### Chain-of-Thought Attacks (CTTA)
Analysis of adversarial techniques that exploit reasoning chains in large language models and hybrid AI architectures.

### Hybrid Architecture Analysis
Comprehensive security assessment of neuro-symbolic AI systems, identifying vulnerabilities at the intersection of neural and symbolic processing.

### Case Studies
Real-world incident analysis providing empirical validation of theoretical vulnerability research through documented attack scenarios and recovery protocols.

## Research Applications

**Academic Research**: Peer-reviewed vulnerability disclosure and security framework development  
**Enterprise Implementation**: Practical security assessment and threat modeling for AI deployments  
**Defensive Development**: Evidence-based countermeasure design and validation protocols

## Contributing

Vulnerability research follows responsible disclosure principles. All findings undergo rigorous validation and coordination with affected parties before publication.

## Research Standards

- **Reproducibility**: All vulnerability claims include reproduction steps and validation evidence
- **Impact Assessment**: Business and technical impact analysis for documented vulnerabilities  
- **Countermeasure Development**: Defensive protocols developed alongside vulnerability research
- **Ethical Framework**: Research conducted under established AI security ethics guidelines
