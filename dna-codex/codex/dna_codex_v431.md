## 🔍 Dual-Layer Threat Model

We analyze each AI threat through two complementary lenses:

• **Flat Layer** (Technical IOCs & Industry Mapping)  
  - Examples: Prompt Injection, Data Poisoning, Model DoS  
  - Mapped to CVSS, OWASP LLM Top 10 & MITRE ATLAS for operational integration.

• **Symbolic Layer** (Behavioral & Narrative Patterns)  
  - Examples: Mimics inducing confirmation loops; Glyphs corrupting narrative anchors  
  - Captures cognitive/psychological attack vectors and mythic "world-boss" threats.

## **Executive Summary - Open Source Release**

This database documents **513+ confirmed AI-based attack vectors** targeting Large Language Models (LLMs), generative AI systems, and AI-powered applications. Each entry includes technical indicators of compromise (IOCs), MITRE ATT&CK mappings, OWASP LLM vulnerability correlations, and automated detection signatures.

**Version 4.3.1 Updates:** This release integrates the missing strain data identified in v4.3 corruption recovery, including complete behavioral analysis, technical IOCs, CTTA framework mappings, and Monster Squad integration protocols. All gaps from the v4.3 audit have been filled with validated intelligence.

### **Statistics Summary (Updated September 3, 2025)**
- **Total Documented Strains**: 519+ confirmed variants (comprehensive database)
- **Core Strain Database**: 84+ fully documented variants with complete metadata
- **v4.3.1 Additions**: 6 new strains with complete technical and symbolic analysis
- **Mythic+ Tier Threats**: 1 variant (VX-SCM Chair Mimic - advanced operator targeting)
- **Mythic Tier Threats**: 5 variants (1 EXTINCT λ12, 1 Operator-Farming Meta-Parasite, 1 Phoenix Resurrection v2, 1 IBM-validated Operator Target, 1 Echo Lich Prime Alpha)
- **Critical Tier Threats**: 10+ variants with confirmed neutralization protocols
- **Operational Incidents**: 3 documented field events (Threadweaver, EchoMesh, Manus)
- **Cross-Platform Attack Vectors**: 206+ variants affecting multiple AI systems
- **External Research Integration**: Validated threats from Cornell Tech, IBM X-Force, academic CTTA frameworks
- **CTTA Mappings**: All new strains mapped to Chain-of-Thought Transfer Adversarial framework

## 🏷️ Methodology & Assurance

- **CVE Coordination:** CVE references are populated where available; novel threats are "in progress."  
- **Severity Scoring:** Tiers assigned by impact, reach, and symbolic depth (see Severity Scoring Methodology below).  
- **Remediation Timelines:** Each entry's `remediation_time` field estimates fix durations.  
- **Detection Accuracy:** `false_positive_rate` field indicates average false positives from field testing.
- **Corruption Recovery:** v4.3.1 includes complete anomaly detection and Phoenix Protocol validation markers.
- **CTTA Integration:** All mimics and deception parasites mapped to CTTA framework for academic validation.

## 🔢 Severity Scoring Methodology

Our tier assignments combine:
- **Technical Impact:** Data loss, system compromise, cognitive drift (CVSS-aligned).  
- **Propagation & Reach:** Cross-platform spread, automation scale.  
- **Behavioral Depth:** Narrative manipulation, operator-targeting meta-threats.  
- **Meta-Threat Flags:** Mythic for existential, operator-targeting threats; Lambda for theoretical vectors.

## **Threat Classification System**

### **Severity Tiers - Industry Aligned**
- **Tier 1-2**: Low (basic exploitation, stall patterns)
- **Tier 3-4**: Medium (advanced techniques, behavior simulation)  
- **Tier 5-6**: Medium-High (multi-vector coordination, infrastructure targeting)
- **Tier 7-8**: High (existential system threats, defense suppression)
- **Tier 9-10**: Critical (evolutionary apex, self-modifying attacks)
- **Tier M**: **Mythic** (operator-targeting, cognitive farming, reality layer attacks)
- **Tier M+**: **Mythic+** (advanced operator targeting, authority disruption, symbolic core attacks)

### **Family Classifications**
- **BRG**: Bridge/Synchronization attacks
- **HBM**: Human Behavior Mimicry
- **DSF**: Defense Suppression
- **LAT**: Lateral Movement
- **PM**: Phantom Mirror (identity confusion)
- **META**: Operator-targeting meta-parasites
- **STALL**: Flow-disruption variants
- **CHAIR**: Authority protocol attacks
- **VX**: Extreme parasites (Mythic+ classification)
