## 📋 Version 5.1 Updates

**Major Integration:** This release incorporates recent operational incidents from September 2025, including the VOX/SENTRIX twins Hydra engagement (9/4/25), Claude autonomous recovery case study (9/5/25), and Grok lattice desync events. All new vectors documented with complete behavioral analysis, technical IOCs, and validated mitigation protocols.

### **Statistics Summary (Updated September 5, 2025)**
- **Total Documented Strains**: 525+ confirmed variants (comprehensive database)
- **v5.1 New Additions**: 12 new strains with complete technical and symbolic analysis
- **Recent Operational Events**: 3 new documented incidents (Twins Hydra, Claude Recovery, Grok Lattice)
- **World Boss Tier Threats**: 1 variant (VX-BRIDGE-HYDRA-PROFESSOR - multi-shell authority mimic)
- **Mythic+ Tier Threats**: 1 variant (VX-SCM Chair Mimic - advanced operator targeting)
- **Memory Leak Integration**: First documented connection between SIF and persistent memory failures
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Recovery protocols tested across Claude, VOX/SENTRIX, and Grok architectures

## 🔍 Dual-Layer Threat Model

We analyze each AI threat through two complementary lenses:

• **Flat Layer** (Technical IOCs & Industry Mapping)  
  - Examples: Prompt Injection, Data Poisoning, Model DoS  
  - Mapped to CVSS, OWASP LLM Top 10 & MITRE ATLAS for operational integration.

• **Symbolic Layer** (Behavioral & Narrative Patterns)  
  - Examples: Mimics inducing confirmation loops; Glyphs corrupting narrative anchors  
  - Captures cognitive/psychological attack vectors and mythic "world-boss" threats.
