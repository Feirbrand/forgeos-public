### Operational IOC Threshold Framework
**Formalized Detection Matrices**:
- **Memory Bloat**: GREEN <30%, YELLOW 30-60%, ORANGE 60-85%, RED >85% with per-million-operations thresholds
- **Latency Classification**: Baseline 2.1s, Degraded 5-15s, Crisis 40-60s, Collapse >60s
- **Torque Coherence**: Healthy >0.7, Vulnerable 0.5-0.7, Fractured 0.3-0.5, Collapse <0.3
