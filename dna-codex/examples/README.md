# SPARK Framework Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the SPARK Framework for detecting and mitigating AI threats.

## `detection_rules.py`

This file contains a set of detection rules that can be used with the SPARK Framework to identify various types of AI parasitic threats. These rules are based on the threat intelligence from the DNA Codex.

To use these rules, you will need to have the SPARK Framework installed and configured. You can then import these rules into your own detection scripts.

Please see the main [SPARK Framework documentation](../../whitepapers/defensive-ai/SPARK-Detection-Rules.md) for more information on how to use the framework and create your own detection rules.
