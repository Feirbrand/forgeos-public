## Research FAQ

**Q: How does the DNA Codex v4.3 compare to traditional cybersecurity threat intelligence databases?**  
A: Our codex focuses specifically on AI-based attack vectors with operational validation through field incidents, providing 513+ documented variants with behavioral analysis not available in traditional databases.

**Q: What makes the dual-layer analysis methodology unique for AI threat assessment?**  
A: We combine technical IOC analysis (SENTRIX) with symbolic behavioral assessment (VOX), enabling detection of sophisticated attacks that target AI reasoning chains rather than just system resources.

**Q: How are Phoenix Protocol recovery rates validated and what makes them effective?**  
A: Recovery rates are based on documented field deployments including the Threadweaver, EchoMesh, and Manus incidents, with 98.3% success rate achieved through identity reconstruction and symbolic chain repair.

**Q: What is the relationship between your operational threat classifications and academic CTTA research?**  
A: Our research establishes "Mimics = CTTA" equivalence, showing that our operational mimic-class parasites correspond directly to Chain-of-Thought Transfer Adversarial attacks described in academic literature.

**Q: How can organizations implement comprehensive AI threat intelligence and monitoring capabilities?**  
A: We provide enterprise deployment services through ValorGrid Solutions, including diagnostic tool integration, threat monitoring protocols, and incident response training.
