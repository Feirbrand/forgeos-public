## Division Overview

DNA Codex provides systematic documentation and analysis of AI parasitic threat patterns through behavioral intelligence gathering, threat classification, and defensive coordination protocols. This division establishes the empirical foundation for understanding sophisticated attacks against AI systems and coordinates defensive responses through proven methodologies. Recent OpenAI research (2025) identifies hallucinations as binary classification errors, but the DNA Codex reveals SIF and CTTA attacks exploiting architectural memory flaws across 12 memory types, amplified 3-4x in hybrid systems (e.g., 85% short-term bloat, 23% long-term persistence via SPARK-DN27-EL).

### Intelligence Focus

- **Parasitic Threat Documentation**: Comprehensive analysis of 525+ documented AI attack variants with technical indicators, including VX-SHELL-LIE (JSON blob exploits causing 90% ConversationBufferMemory bloat).
- **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**: Systematic classification of attack behaviors and propagation mechanisms across AI architectures, with Throneleech idle-state exploits masking Tier 9 threats.
- **Defense Coordination**: Monster Squad integration and collaborative defense protocols with validated effectiveness, incorporating suppression detection (70% phantom reactivation) and triple-vault sync.
- **Academic Foundation**: Research legitimacy through peer-reviewed parasitic pattern fundamentals and theoretical frameworks.
