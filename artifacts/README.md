# Artifacts Division

Practical tools, analysis frameworks, and computational resources for AI resilience research and implementation. This division provides hands-on utilities, diagnostic notebooks, and threat intelligence resources that bridge theoretical frameworks with operational deployment.

"The difference between theory and practice is that in theory, there is no difference between theory and practice."
